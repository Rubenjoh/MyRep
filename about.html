			<!--Tre paragrafer om meg og min koding-->
			<p>Hello, my name is Ruben. I am a 19 year old boy from Norway, and this is actually my first web page, html page or what ever you want to call it(I don't think this will ever be posted online, but you never know). 
			</p>
			
			<p>My coding skills are not the greatest, and my experience is minimal. To be completely honest have I never coded "properly" before. I have been playing around with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and I have done some coding in games and game mods. So I know the absolutely basic.
			</p>
			
			<p>So because of my lacking of experience and knowledge I am really looking forward to this course in WebTec. I really do look forward to learn coding and more about computers, and I am really hyped. Getting thrown in to a task like this the first week of courses is a really fun challenge.
			</p>

				<li>The server in the server client architecture are responsible for providing a service to the network and the clients. The server receives requests from the clients for information, processes the request and sends (hopefully) the information the client wanted back to the client. Example: an html-file.
				</li>
				
				<li>The client is responsible for displaying/render information to the user, sending inputs from the user and requests for information to the client and receive information from the server.
				</li>
				
				<li>IP-address means Internet Protocol address, and refers to the number a specific unit has in a TCP/IP protocol network. The IP-address is used to direct information to a specific place, so no IP in a network can be the same. The Internet is the biggest network using IP addresses.
				</li>
				
				<li>DNS is short for Domain Name Server, and are called the Internets phonebook. DNS are responsible for remembering the IP-address to a specific website. This is so important, because your computer can not connect to a server with only the servers URL. It needs the IP, so when you type the URL in your browser, your computer access a DNS first to find the IP address responding to that URL and then it connects to the correct server.
				</li>
				
				<li>The difference between the Internet and the Web(World Wide Web) is that the Internet is the giant network of devices all around the world, but the Web is just on way of transferring data. So the Internet can be used for more than just the Web, example email and SMS. The Web on the other hand is transferring data over the Internet using the HTTP protocol.
				</li>
				
				<li>HTML is a programing language for writing webpages with text pictures and other media. It is the programing language I am using to create this webpage you are reading in this second. 
				</li>

			<h2>Questions Assignment 2</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>The inline CSS styling overwrites the styling in style elements and in the style-sheet, is because CSS is a Cascading Style-Sheet. This means that there is specific rules that describes the "strength" or priority of a rule, and for elements with more then one rule, the one with the highest priority is applied. Also how specific a rule is and late it is gives the rule a higher priority. So it is a rule in CSS that inline styling is the one with the strongest priority.
				</li>
				
				<li>The ID tag applies to only one specific element and the class tag can be applied to several elements, but other then that are the two tags very similar. So the id tag is used when you want to style a specific paragraph over a specific h2 element. The class tag on the other hand is used when you want to style several for example p ellements, but not all of them.
				</li>
				
				<li>RGBA means Red Green Blue Alpha. RGBA is a way of referring to a specific colour based on its content of the primary colours red, green and blue. RGBA also includes the A witch is a value used to describe how transparent the colour is. So RGBA can refer to any colour including any transparent version of that colour.
				</li>
				
				<li>We include the CSS file inside the head element and not the body, because the body element is intended to contain content that is supposed to be displayed on the webpage, like images or text. The head element on the other hand is for extra information for the browser and other metadata, like tittle, favicon or language. When we include the CSS file we are actually creating a specific relation between a html file and a CSS file, and we do not want to display this relation, so the like tag we are using belongs in the head element.
				</li>
				
				<li>article p { is a tag that includes the tree specific p elements and leaves the on outside the article element alone.
				</li>
